\chapter{Discussion and Conclusions}

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Robustness}

The results of the perturbation analysis demonstrate that the model exhibits robustness to approximately half of the applied perturbations, including ghosting, blurring, and motion artifacts with The Delta Dice coefficient exhibited a maximum variation of approximately 0.1 for the most severe cases assessed. During model training, various intensity augmentations were employed, such as Gaussian noise, smoothing, intensity shifts, and contrast adjustments. These augmentations were expected to enhance the model’s performance under these perturbations. However, it is important to note that these augmentations were applied exclusively to the CT modality, while the PET modality also demonstrated resilience to these perturbations.
This observed robustness of the PET modality to perturbations such as blur, motion, and ghosting could be attributed to its lower structural complexity compared to CT. PET imaging primarily provides functional information in the form of Standardized Uptake Value (SUV) heatmaps, which are inherently less reliant on fine anatomical details. As a result, PET images may exhibit a natural resistance to perturbations that distort or duplicate structural features, such as blur and ghosting, which typically affect high-resolution modalities like CT. Moreover, the lack of intricate anatomical structures in PET likely contributes to its relative insensitivity to motion artifacts, as these perturbations do not significantly compromise the functional information provided by the heatmaps.

Interestingly, despite the inclusion of noise augmentation during training, the model showed lower robustness to noise compared to the aforementioned perturbations. The model remained relatively robust at lower levels of noise severity, but performance degraded as the noise severity increased. On the other hand, perturbations such as spike noise and bias were particularly problematic, causing significant degradation in performance even at the lowest levels of severity with the Delta Dice coefficient approached values as high as 1 or near it.
\newpage
Consultation with a clinician revealed that the severity of the applied perturbations was higher than what is typically encountered in clinical practice. According to the clinician, such extreme perturbations would likely warrant image re-acquisition. This insight suggests that the model's demonstrated robustness to motion, blur, and ghosting artifacts is likely to hold in real-world scenarios, where such perturbations occur at lower levels of severity. Consequently, the model's performance under these conditions may be considered sufficient for practical clinical applications. Nevertheless, to improve the model’s robustness to these more severe perturbations, future training could incorporate augmentations involving bias, spike , and higher levels of noise severity. This approach could potentially enhance the model’s resilience to these challenging conditions.

The analysis of spatial properties such as volume, surface area, boundary length, and entropy reveals an average correlation of approximately 0.3 with perturbations including spike, bias, and noise in nodal tumors. This observation suggests that larger and more complex regions are more susceptible to these perturbations. Conversely, a negative correlation was identified in PET imaging for both channels concerning motion and blur, with correlation values reaching as low as -0.56 for blur. Furthermore, the bias exhibited a negative correlation for the primary label in PET imaging, indicating that smaller and less complex primary tumors are disproportionately affected by these perturbations compared to nodal tumors.

Additionally, when perturbations are introduced in CT imaging, particularly for primary tumors, the variability and maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) in PET demonstrate stronger correlations than observed in scenarios where perturbations are applied directly to PET. This finding suggests that the model tends to prioritize the PET signal when the CT modality is compromised. In contrast, the intensity properties of CT do not yield significantly higher correlations with PET when subjected to perturbations compared to the effects observed when perturbations are directly applied to PET.

Moreover, focusing on PET variability, we observed a prominent negative correlation of approximately -0.45 for primary tumors under PET perturbations, indicating that the impact of blur is more pronounced in less variable signals. Overall, examining the specific effects of perturbations rather than solely focusing on spatial properties indicates that the most impactful perturbations—specifically bias, noise, and spike—tend to correlate with higher values. In the context of PET imaging, the perturbations of blur and motion exhibit negative correlations across both channels, while bias correlates negatively only for the primary channel. This suggests that generally, the lower the values of properties such as size, intensity, variability, and complexity, the more significantly the segmentation is affected by these perturbations.
