  abstract = {The presence of cervical lymph node metastases is a major prognostic factor in squamous cell carcinoma 
    of the head and neck. The presence of a solitary ipsilateral metastatic lymph node reduces expected survival by almost 50%, 
    and the presence of regional metastatic nodes at the time of presentation is the strongest predictor of recurrence or the 
    development of distant metastases or both. Accurate identification of metastatic cervical lymph nodes is essential for 
    staging and treatment planning. Pretreatment imaging is important for identifying clinically occult pathologic nodes 
    as well as delineating nodal size and morphologic characteristics used in staging. This review emphasizes the role of
    traditional imaging modalities and criteria, including evaluation for extranodal extension.},

    Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) 2022. The challenge comprises two tasks related to the automatic analysis of FDG-PET/CT
    images for patients with Head and Neck cancer (H&N), focusing on the oropharynx region. Task 1 is the fully automatic
    segmentation of H&N primary Gross Tumor Volume (GTVp) and metastatic lymph nodes (GTVn) from FDG-PET/CT images.
    Task 2 is the fully automatic prediction of Recurrence-Free Survival (RFS) from the same FDG-PET/CT and clinical data.
    The data were collected from nine centers for a total of 883 cases consisting of FDG-PET/CT images and clinical information,
    split into 524 training and 359 test cases. The best methods obtained an aggregated Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSCagg) 
    of 0.788 in Task 1, and a Concordance index (C-index) of 0.682 in Task 2.},

  abstract = {Extracapsular extension (ECE) in the lymph nodes is a poor prognostic factor in head and neck cancer. This study evaluates predictive factors for ECE on computed tomography (CT) imaging in patients undergoing surgery and analyzes outcomes. A retrospective review of 82 patients with biopsy-proven squamous cell carcinomas who underwent definitive surgery was conducted. CT scans were assessed for nodal involvement, size, and central necrosis. ECE on postoperative pathology was significantly associated with central necrosis observed on preoperative CT (p=0.013). Higher incidence of ECE was noted in poorly differentiated tumors and nodal stages >N2c. Patients with ECE had poorer disease-free and overall survival. The study suggests that predicting ECE based on CT findings can aid in formulating appropriate treatment strategies and proposes further investigation into additional chemotherapy for patients with ECE.},

  abstract = {Identification of nodal metastasis and tumor extranodal extension (ENE) is crucial for head and neck cancer management, but currently can only be diagnosed via postoperative pathology. Pretreatment radiographic identification of ENE has been extremely challenging but would significantly influence patient management. This study demonstrates that a deep learning convolutional neural network can identify nodal metastasis and ENE with superior performance compared to traditional clinical methods. A 3D convolutional neural network was trained on 2,875 CT-segmented lymph node samples with pathology labels, and fine-tuned on 124 samples, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.91 (95% CI: 0.85-0.97) on a blinded test set. The model holds potential as a clinical decision-making tool to guide head and neck cancer management.},

  abstract = {Surgery alone for resectable locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) has resulted in high rates of locoregional recurrences despite adequate resection. To improve outcomes, postoperative radiotherapy (RT) was investigated as an adjuvant treatment to decrease locoregional failure rates. However, results were unsatisfactory for patients with high-risk features, leading to the exploration of concurrent chemotherapy. Prospective randomized trials by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) demonstrated that cisplatin-based chemotherapy improved locoregional control (LRC) and disease-free survival (DFS), with significant improvement in overall survival (OS) observed in the EORTC trial. Extracapsular extension (ECE) of nodal disease has been identified as a high-risk feature negatively impacting LRC and survival. This article reviews the evolution of treatment strategies for resectable advanced HNSCC and the impact of ECE on clinical outcomes. It concludes that adjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) significantly improves outcomes for high-risk patients, and precise definition of ECE is crucial for optimal treatment selection.},

  abstract = {Objective: To clarify CT diagnostic performance in extranodal extension of cervical lymph node metastases using deep learning classification. Methods: Seven-hundred and three CT images (178 with and 525 without extranodal extension) in 51 patients with cervical lymph node metastases from oral squamous cell carcinoma were enrolled in this study. CT images were cropped to an arbitrary size to include lymph nodes and surrounding tissues. All images were automatically divided into two datasets, assigning 80% as the training dataset and 20% as the testing dataset. The automated selection was repeated five times. Each training dataset was imported to a deep learning training system "DIGITS". Five learning models were created after 300 epochs of the learning process using a neural network "AlexNet". Each testing dataset was applied to each created learning model and resulting five performances were averaged as estimated diagnostic performances. A radiologist measured the minor axis and three radiologists evaluated central necrosis and irregular borders of each lymph node, and the diagnostic performances were obtained.},
