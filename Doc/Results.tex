\section{Robustness}
\subsection{Perturbations effects}
The following graphs illustrates the impact of perturbations on segmentation performance. 
The columns correspond to the baseline and the six different perturbations (\ref{list:perturbations}). The rows depict the delta values of 
various segmentation metrics (\ref{list:metrics}), indicating the extent of variation in segmentation performance due to the perturbations. 
The baseline, having no delta, represents the original values for each metric. Each of the three boxplots corresponds to 
one of three levels of perturbation severity, providing a visual representation of how segmentation performance is affected 
at increasing degrees of perturbation.

The graph below represents the scenario in which perturbations are applied to nodal tumor labels in the CT modality.

The graph illustrates significant variations in the Dice coefficient under spike, bias, and noise perturbations, 
underscoring their substantial impact on segmentation performance across both labels. Notably, the Hausdorff 
distance demonstrates that bias perturbation exerts the most pronounced negative effect, with the boxplot range extending 
up to 200. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy metrics exhibit trends consistent with the Dice coefficient, revealing 
markedly larger effects under spike, bias, and noise perturbations. In contrast, the model demonstrates relative robustness 
against motion, blur, and ghost perturbations, as indicated by minimal performance variability across all metrics.

Moreover, noise perturbation exhibits a less pronounced effect at the initial degree of severity compared to higher levels, 
while spike and bias perturbations show significant impact even at the first degree. 

Interestingly, in certain cases, the Dice coefficient delta is negative, indicating an improvement in segmentation 
performance under perturbation.This behavior suggests that certain perturbations may occasionally enhance segmentation accuracy, 
depending on the model and context.

\end{figure}
The two graphs demonstrate the effect of perturbations on PET images across both labels. 
Similar to the behavior observed in CT images, spike, bias, and noise perturbations have a pronounced impact, 
while blur, ghost, and motion perturbations exhibit a more robust and stable performance. However, 
in the case of PET images, the first degree of noise and spike perturbations shows less variation in the Dice coefficient, 
sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy, indicating greater robustness compared to CT images. In contrast, 
bias perturbation continues to exert a substantial effect even at the first degree of severity, particularly 
in the Hausdorff distance, where a significant impact is still observed.

\subsection{Correlation with properties}
The following graphs present the correlation between the 13 previously discussed properties of the segmentation area (ref{}). Similar to the earlier graph, the figures are organized into 7 columns, with the baseline in the first column and the 6 perturbations in the subsequent columns. The baseline scatter plot illustrates the correlation between the original Dice coefficient and the segmentation properties, establishing a reference for the unperturbed performance. The columns corresponding to each perturbation display the correlation between the delta Dice (change in Dice coefficient) and the segmentation properties, highlighting whether significant segmentation degradation is associated with specific properties.

Each scatter plot includes data for all three degrees of perturbation, represented by distinct markers, allowing for visual differentiation of the effects of increasing perturbation severity. Also, the pearson correlation coefficient is visible for each degree.
The graphs presented here represent cases where perturbations have been applied to the nodal label in the CT modality. 
The remaining three category (Primary in CT, Nodal and Primary in PET) will be provided in the appendix (\ref{chap:CorrProp}). A more comprehensive correlation graph, encompassing all 
four categories, will follow to offer a broader view of the relationships between the segmentation properties and the applied perturbations.
\begin{figure}[ht]

    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{images/CT_Nodal_Properties_1.png}
    \caption{Correlation with perturbations applied to nodal tumor labels in the CT modality}
    \label{fig:three_subfigures}
\end{figure}

On the left, the Dice coefficient exhibits a crescent-shaped distribution rather than a clear linear correlation for the three properties related to tumor size and shape. The correlation is consistently higher for perturbations that exert a greater impact, as anticipated. In contrast, blur, motion, and ghost perturbations present a significantly flatter scatter plot with considerably smaller variations, reflecting the robustness observed in earlier analyses.

Among the perturbations, spike and noise demonstrate the strongest correlation with volume and surface area, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.30 to 0.42, the highest being associated with surface area. In the case of bias, the correlation coefficient increases across the degrees of perturbation, showing a very low correlation at the first degree. By the third degree, the correlation reaches levels comparable to those of other perturbations. Notably, bias exhibits the highest correlation with compactness, although this correlation is not statistically significant, peaking at 0.21.

Interestingly, ghost perturbation reveals a prominent negative correlation, suggesting an improvement in segmentation performance, with the strongest correlation observed with the compactness property.

    \label{fig:three_subfigures}
\end{figure}

The distance from the center did not demonstrate a significant correlation with any perturbation, with the highest coefficient reaching only 0.17. In contrast, for the boundary length, spike and noise perturbations exhibited correlation coefficients ranging from 0.20 to 0.30, while bias showed a correlation of 0.34 at the third degree of perturbation.

Regarding intensity properties, in CT variations, the only perturbation that displayed a significant correlation was noise, with coefficients of 0.38 and 0.31, but only at the first two degrees of severity. For PET variations, the correlation with noise was lower; however, spike demonstrated a stronger correlation, achieving a score of up to 0.41.

In terms of contrast, PET generally exhibited greater correlation, particularly with spike, which reached a maximum of 0.61. The third degree of noise showed a correlation of 0.38, while bias presented a more moderate correlation, peaking at 0.29.

\end{figure}

For the last four properties analyzed, the SUVmax demonstrated a moderate correlation with spike perturbations, ranging from 0.29 to 0.43 across the degrees of severity. Noise and bias also exhibited correlations, albeit at more moderate levels, around 0.20. In the case of CT number, spike perturbations again displayed the strongest correlation, peaking at 0.32, while a surprising correlation of 0.28 was observed with ghost perturbations at the third degree. Notably, noise exhibited irregular behavior, with correlation coefficients fluctuating between -0.40 and 0.20.

The regions showed inconsistent behavior across properties, except for spike, which revealed a stable negative correlation ranging from -0.16 to -0.26. As expected, entropy demonstrated stronger correlations with effective perturbations, particularly spike, which reached values of up to 0.39, and bias at the third degree, which peaked at 0.42. Noise showed a more consistent behavior across degrees, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.30 to 0.36.

Overall, among the 13 properties examined, the strongest correlations were observed with perturbations that most significantly affected segmentation performance. In contrast, blur, motion, and ghost perturbations exhibited only minor correlations due to their limited variability. For spike, bias, and noise, the correlation coefficients generally clustered around 0.30 to 0.40, with occasional peaks reaching up to 0.60.

In the following section, a more comprehensive correlation graphic will present the Pearson correlation coefficients of the various properties across each perturbation and degree, as well as for the four categories of images. This analysis will encompass both labels and modalities, providing a detailed overview of the relationships between segmentation properties and the applied perturbations.

\newpage
Starting with the nodal label in the CT modality (a), we observe the same general trends identified in the previous section. The highest correlations are consistently seen with spike, bias, and noise perturbations, with most properties showing strong correlations with these perturbations. Notable exceptions include compactness, distance from center, CT variations, CT contrast, and regions, which do not exhibit significant correlations.

Spike emerges as the perturbation with the highest correlation scores, followed by noise and then bias. In contrast, ghost perturbations generally show an improvement in segmentation performance across most properties, with the strongest negative correlation observed for compactness. The only exception is CT contrast, which displays a positive correlation with ghost perturbations.

Blur and motion perturbations exhibit similar behavior, showing low correlation coefficients, consistent with previous analyses. Properties such as volume, surface area, boundary length, PET variations, SUVmax, and entropy display comparable responses to the perturbations. These properties generally show moderate positive correlations with spike, bias, and noise, while ghost perturbations produce negative correlations. Motion and blur have a minimal effect, with low correlation coefficients.

\vskip1em
In the primary tumor on the CT modality (b), a noticeable difference was observed between the two labels, particularly in the effect of compactness, which had a greater impact with lower segmentation degradation. Volume, surface area, boundary length, and entropy exhibited similar effects, primarily influencing spike perturbations, though with reduced correlation in the presence of bias and noise.

For nodal tumors, SUVmax showed an effect across all perturbations, with a negative correlation under motion, while CT number had a reduced influence. Regions continued to improve segmentation but to a lesser extent compared to nodal tumors. Variability in PET data correlated with blur, noise, and ghost perturbations, whereas CT data showed more correlation with motion. Contrast behavior for both modalities was similar to nodal tumors, though with weaker correlation for CT under motion perturbations.
\vskip1em
For the nodal region in the PET modality (c), the behavior of volume, surface area, boundary length, and entropy remains consistent with prior observations but demonstrates notable differences. These properties exhibit a strong positive correlation with spike, bias, and noise perturbations, and a strong negative correlation with blur and motion, with no significant effect observed for ghost perturbations.

SUVmax follows a similar trend to these four properties, though with a reduced correlation in the presence of bias perturbations. Compactness showed a positive correlation with bias, similar to distance from the center, while also presenting a negative correlation with blur.

Both intensity variabilities demonstrated negative correlations with blur and motion, and positive correlations with noise. PET variability additionally showed a stronger positive correlation with spike perturbations compared to CT.

For contrast, CT exhibited a positive correlation with blur and ghost perturbations, while PET showed a stronger correlation with spike and noise, accompanied by a slight negative correlation with blur and motion. The regional segmentation improvements observed previously were no longer general across all perturbations, instead showing a concentrated effect on spike perturbations.
\newpage
For primary tumors in the PET modality (d), the four properties volume, surface area, boundary length, and entropy exhibit similar behavior as in prior observations. However, unlike in nodal tumors, the overall correlation is reduced, with a notable shift in bias correlation from positive to negative.

SUVmax is primarily correlated with spike and noise perturbations. The CT number shows significantly less impact compared to nodal tumors, with consistently low correlation coefficients, a pattern also observed for the regions.

Compactness demonstrates a negative correlation with blur and motion, with a slight positive correlation observed with noise.

For intensity variabilities, PET shows a strong negative correlation with blur and a less pronounced negative correlation with motion. In contrast, CT exhibits a positive correlation with noise.

Regarding contrast, PET shows correlations with spike, ghost, blur, and the third degree of noise, while CT primarily correlates with blur and motion.
\vskip1em
Upon conducting a comprehensive comparison of the four graphs, it becomes evident that for the CT modality, the nodal tumor label exhibits a strong correlation with spike, noise, and bias, while the correlation for primary tumors is more distributed across various image properties, demonstrating specific and notable correlations.

In contrast, the PET modality reveals a higher prevalence of negative correlations, particularly with respect to motion and blur for both nodal and primary tumor labels. For nodal tumors in PET, positive correlations are similarly concentrated around spike, noise, and bias, akin to the CT modality. However, a distinguishing feature for nodal tumors in PET is the shift of bias towards negative correlation, and no clear resemblance with the CT modality is observed. Additionally, correlations in PET for nodal tumors are noted with spike, noise, and some degree of correlation with ghost artifacts.

Furthermore, across all degrees of severity for each perturbation, the correlation behavior is mostly not linear with increasing severity levels.

\newpage
\section{Clinical evaluation}
The following graphs illustrate the distribution of the 5-star clinical evaluations. The left graph represents the original cases, comprising 32 evaluations, while the right graph shows the perturbed cases, with a total of 18 evaluations.
\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{images/Clinical_evaluation_repartition.png}
    \caption{Clinical evaluation repartition}
    \label{fig:three_subfigures}
\end{figure}

The analysis of the original cases reveals that approximately 75\% of the evaluations fall between 3 and 4 stars for both channels. Notably, the nodal channel exhibits a slightly higher incidence of 2-star evaluations, alongside a reduction in the extreme values of 1 and 5 stars compared to the primary channel.

In contrast, the perturbation analysis indicates that the nodal channel was significantly more affected by the applied perturbations in the selected cases with majority of 1 and 2 stars. Conversely, the distribution of evaluations for the primary channel remains consistent with that of the original cases but with some changes including more 4 stars suprisingly and not any 5 stars.

In the subsequent graphs, we will further investigate whether these changes are also reflected in the DICE coefficient measurements, which would be indicated with a significant correlation between the DICE coefficient and the evaluation scores.
\newpage
This graph that follows represent the corresponding 5 categories of dice coefficient for the same cases. With each category having a range of 0.2 from 0 to 1.
Which would arbitrarly represent the gradinds in likert scale.
\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{images/Clinical_evaluation_dice_repartition.png}
    \caption{Clinical evaluation repartition}
    \label{fig:three_subfigures}
\end{figure}

For the original labels, approximately 70\% of the scores are above 0.60, with a similar distribution for scores below this threshold. In contrast, the perturbed labels show a notable decline, particularly for the nodal labels, where 50\% of the scores fall between 0 and 0.2, and over 75\% of the scores are below 0.6. The primary labels, however, maintain a similar distribution to the original, except that no scores are observed between 0.2 and 0.4.

Both grading systems and Dice coefficients follow a similar pattern, with a marked decline in nodal label performance under perturbation. Scores above 0.6 generally align with higher grading levels (3- and 4-star ratings).

\newpage
The following graphs illustrate the correlation among three metrics: the DICE coefficient, Hausdorff distance, and Jaccard index, 
in relation to clinical evaluation gradings. The correlation analysis is conducted across both channels for the original 32 cases. 
The Likert gradings are plotted on the x-axis, while the metrics are represented on the y-axis. In each plot, the correlation trend 
line is depicted in red, with the Pearson correlation coefficient displayed in the top right corner.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{images/Correlation_dice_eval.png}
    \caption{Clinical evaluation correlation with DICE on original cases}
    \label{fig:three_subfigures}
\end{figure}

The Jaccard index and DICE coefficient exhibit similar behavior, characterized by closely aligned trend lines and Pearson correlation coefficients. In contrast, the Hausdorff distance demonstrates a weaker correlation, particularly noting that cases lacking ground truth data have been excluded due to the metric's sensitivity in these instances.

Across the two most reliable metrics, the primary label exhibits a stronger correlation, with values 0.665 and 0.656, compared to the nodal channel, which shows a correlation of 0.518 and 0.551.
We see also that the range of dice coefficient has a tendecy to shrink to higher grading.

Notably, some cases rated with four stars display low DICE coefficients. These specific cases have been reviewed with clinical experts and are reported to be particularly challenging, as they were difficult to evaluate without supplementary information beyond the image alone.
\newpage 

Here is the same graphs but for the 18 perturbed cases cases.
\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{images/Correlation_dice_eval_perturbed.png}
    \caption{Clinical evaluation correlation with DICE on perturbed cases}
    \label{fig:three_subfigures}
\end{figure}

Consistent with before the Dice and Jaccard exhibit better correlation than Hausdorff even if the Hausdorff is way better than before.
A major difference here is that the correlation for nodal channel is really high (around 0.9) and bigger than for primary channel.
For primary channel almost all metrics value are above the 50\% of the max value for Dice and Jaccard.
